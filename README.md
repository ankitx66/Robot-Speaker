1. Importing the os module:

The os module is used to interact with the operating system. Here, it is specifically used to execute system commands.

2. Main program logic:
if __name__ == '__main__': ensures that the code block runs only if the script is executed directly, not if it's imported as a module in another script.
print("Welcome to RoboSpeaker Version 1.0 Created by Ankit") displays a welcome message.

3. Infinite loop to take user input:
while True: starts an infinite loop that will continue until the user decides to quit.
x = input("Enter what you want me to speak (or 'q' to quit): ") prompts the user to enter a phrase.
if x.lower() == 'q': break checks if the input is 'q' (or 'Q'), and if so, it breaks the loop, ending the program.
command = f"say {x}" constructs a command string that uses the say command (available on macOS) to convert text to speech.
os.system(command) executes the constructed command, making the system speak the input text.

Notes:
The say command used in this script is specific to macOS. On other operating systems, you would need a different command to achieve the same functionality.
The script will keep running and asking for user input until the user types 'q' to quit.
